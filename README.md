# 524_lab2_ex5

Contains documentation for a class that my partner, Kai, will write the code for. 

Refer to [car.R](car.R) for documentation (tried using devtools::document() but it won't work).

UPDATE:
Kai wrote the implementation and I added my tests to check if his code worked. And it did. To check for yourself, open the file: [car.R](car.R).

I've also included the implementation I wrote for Kai's documentation in [kai.R](kai.R).
